//! Text-to-Speech pipeline for huddle agent voice output.
//!
//! Mental model:
//!
//! ```text
//! caller: pipeline.speak("Hello world. How are you?")
//!   → bounded sync_channel (TEXT_QUEUE_DEPTH = 8)
//!   → tts_worker thread (owns 1 Pocket TTS engine + 1 persistent Player)
//!       1. Preprocess text
//!       2. Split into sentences
//!       3. Synthesize each sentence individually → f32 PCM
//!       4. Apply volume boost + fade out to each sentence
//!       5. Append each buffer to the persistent rodio Player (gapless)
//!       6. While audio is draining, keep pulling queued text items and
//!          synthesizing ahead — playback of item N overlaps synthesis of
//!          item N+1
//!   → tts_active = true while audio is queued/playing, false when idle
//!   → cancel flag: player.clear() + drain queue + player.play() (un-pause)
//! ```
//!
//! Lookahead pipelining spans *items*, not just sentences within one item:
//! the worker only blocks on the text channel when the player is empty.
//! With sentence-per-message delivery (each agent message ≈ one sentence),
//! a per-item drain barrier would insert a full synth latency of dead air
//! between every pair of sentences — the cross-item overlap is what keeps
//! multi-message replies gapless.
//!
//! `tts_active` is an `Arc<AtomicBool>` shared with the STT pipeline so STT
//! can gate microphone input while the agent is speaking.

/// # Why no fade-in
///
/// An earlier revision (pre 2026-05) symmetrically faded *in* over the same
/// 8 ms window. That swallowed the leading consonant attack on every
/// sentence — Pocket TTS produces real audio energy inside the first
/// millisecond (RMS ≈ 0.02, peak ≈ 0.03 measured across four prompts in
/// `examples/pocket_onset_probe.rs`), and a linear 0→1 ramp over 192 samples
/// scales those onset samples by ≤50 % for the first ~4 ms. The result was
/// the "first little sound or two is missing" regression heard on
/// 2026-05-18.
///
/// The first sample of Pocket output measures ≈ 0.0018 (≈ −54 dBFS) — well
/// below the threshold at which a DC-jump would be audible as a click — so
/// no fade-in is needed. The OS audio device gets its quiet ramp-up window
/// from `SENTENCE_LEAD_IN_SAMPLES` instead, inserted as pure silence before
/// each sentence buffer.

/// Build the single buffer appended to the rodio `Player` for one synthesised
/// sentence.
///
/// Every sentence chunk gets a short lead-in pad immediately before its audio.
/// This matters for chunks that start with soft first phonemes (`I'm`, `I've`):
/// the synthesized buffer can begin with speech within the first millisecond,
/// so the playback layer must provide the device/mixer cushion.
/// To keep the audible gap unchanged, the trailing silence after this chunk is
/// shortened by the same amount (`silence_buf_len - SENTENCE_LEAD_IN_SAMPLES`):
/// sentence N contributes 80 ms of post-speech silence and sentence N+1
/// contributes the remaining 20 ms of pre-speech cushion.
///
/// The lead-in, audio, and trailing silence are concatenated into one
/// `SamplesBuffer` before appending. This keeps rodio's queue shape at one
/// tracked source per synthesized sentence, avoiding source-boundary/drain
/// regressions from enqueueing the lead-in, audio, and tail as separate sounds.
///
/// `first_append` is flipped on the first call after the player goes idle.
/// The worker uses it in the idle branch of the main loop to distinguish
