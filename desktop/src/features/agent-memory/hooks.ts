/**
 * Synchronous gate: does this desktop manage the agent? Used by the profile
 * panel to hide the Memory section entirely for non-owners.
 *
 * Returns `boolean | undefined`:
 *   - `undefined` is the *loading* state (managed-agent list still resolving).
 *     Callers should defer rendering, not show an error.
 *   - `true` / `false` once the list is known.
 *
 * Why `managed_agents` (not NIP-OA `kind:0` via `useOaOwnerQuery`)?
 * The archive button gates on `useOaOwnerQuery` because publishing a
 * `kind:9035` requires verifying NIP-OA cryptographically — the action is
 * *signing as the OA owner*. The memory viewer's question is different:
 * "do I have the seckey to decrypt this agent's engrams?" `managed_agents`
 * answers exactly that — it's the local source of truth for "agents whose
 * keys this desktop holds." NIP-OA on its own is weaker for this surface:
 * a malicious agent can forge an `auth` tag in their `kind:0` pointing at
 * any pubkey, but only the desktop that actually holds the seckey can
 * decrypt. Don't "fix" this back to `useOaOwnerQuery` — it would replace
 * a precise predicate with a weaker one and add a relay roundtrip.
 *
 * Lowercase compare because pubkeys can arrive from either side in mixed
 * case via Nostr libs; the underlying store stores them as-given.
